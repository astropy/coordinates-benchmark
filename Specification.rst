Astropy Coordinates Benchmark
=============================

Here we compare astropy coordinate conversion results against other Python packages.

This was proposed and discussed here:
https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/astropy-dev/tbcpMQ1rOcY

Introduction
------------

To be able to compare results from different coordinate conversion packages, we need to make sure the input and output "sky definitions" are well defined.

Note that with some conversions arcsecond, milli-arcsecond or even micro-arcsecond precision can be achieved.

We follow http://www.astro.rug.nl/software/kapteyn/celestial.html#sky-definitions which states that a "sky definition" consists of four things::

* Sky system (equatorial, ecliptic, galactic, supergalactic)
* Reference system (fk4, fk4_no_e, fk5, icrs, j2000, dynj2000)
* Equinox (e.g. B1950, J2000)
* Epoch of observation (e.g. B1950, J2000, J2012)

Although not all four values have to be specified all the time, because for some "sky definitions" only some fixed values are allowed for the other parameters.

To understand this better, you can read these documents::

* http://www.astro.rug.nl/software/kapteyn/celestial.html
* http://www.astro.rug.nl/software/kapteyn/celestialbackground.html

Or play around with the `kapteyn.celestial.skyparser <http://www.astro.rug.nl/software/kapteyn/celestial.html#celestial.skyparser>`_ ::

	>>> from kapteyn.celestial import skyparser
	>>> skyparser('fk5')
	(0, 6, 2000.0, None)
	>>> skyparser('fk4')
	(0, 4, 1950.0, None)
	>>> skyparser('galactic')
	(2, None, None, None)
	>>> skyparser('ecliptic')
	(1, 7, 2000.0, None)
	>>> skyparser('fk4 J2000')
	(0, 4, 2000.0012775136654, None)
	>>> skyparser('ecliptic B1950')
	(1, 4, 1950.0, None)
	>>> skyparser('galactic J2000')
	(2, None, None, None)
	>>> skyparser('galactic B1950')
	(2, None, None, None)


Just as an example, you can see that the "galactic" sky system is apparently well-defined, no need to specify a reference system, equinox or epoch of observation. To see why that is you can read the background information at http://www.astro.rug.nl/software/kapteyn/celestialbackground.html#galactic-coordinates

 
Precision
---------

At the moment we have one input list of coordinates in ``initial_coords.txt``,
generated by ``generate.py``, which is supposed to be interpreted as ``FK5 J2000`` coordinates.

Currently we compare results for the following sky definitions:

===================  ========== ================ ======= ====================
Filename             Sky System Reference System Equinox Epoch of observation
===================  ========== ================ ======= ====================
initial_coords.txt   equatorial fk5              J2000   ???
coords_galactic.txt  galactic   ???              ???     ???
coords_b1950.txt     equatorial fk4              B1950   ???
coords_ecliptic.txt  ecliptic   ???              J2000   ???
===================  ========== ================ ======= ====================
