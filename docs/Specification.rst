Astropy Coordinates Benchmark
=============================

Introduction
------------

To be able to compare results from different coordinate conversion packages, we need to make sure the input and output "sky definitions" are well defined.

Note that with some conversions arcsecond, milli-arcsecond or even micro-arcsecond precision can be achieved.

We follow http://www.astro.rug.nl/software/kapteyn/celestial.html#sky-definitions which states that a "sky definition" consists of four things::

* Sky system (equatorial, ecliptic, galactic, supergalactic)
* Reference system (fk4, fk4_no_e, fk5, icrs, j2000, dynj2000)
* Equinox (e.g. B1950, J2000)
* Epoch of observation (e.g. B1950, J2000, J2012)

Although not all four values have to be specified all the time, because for some "sky definitions" only some fixed values are allowed for the other parameters.

To understand this better, you can read these documents::

* http://www.astro.rug.nl/software/kapteyn/celestial.html
* http://www.astro.rug.nl/software/kapteyn/celestialbackground.html

Or play around with the `kapteyn.celestial.skyparser <http://www.astro.rug.nl/software/kapteyn/celestial.html#celestial.skyparser>`_ ::

	>>> from kapteyn.celestial import skyparser
	>>> skyparser('fk5')
	(0, 6, 2000.0, None)
	>>> skyparser('fk4')
	(0, 4, 1950.0, None)
	>>> skyparser('galactic')
	(2, None, None, None)
	>>> skyparser('ecliptic')
	(1, 7, 2000.0, None)
	>>> skyparser('fk4 J2000')
	(0, 4, 2000.0012775136654, None)
	>>> skyparser('ecliptic B1950')
	(1, 4, 1950.0, None)
	>>> skyparser('galactic J2000')
	(2, None, None, None)
	>>> skyparser('galactic B1950')
	(2, None, None, None)


Just as an example, you can see that the "galactic" sky system is apparently well-defined, no need to specify a reference system, equinox or epoch of observation. To see why that is you can read the background information at http://www.astro.rug.nl/software/kapteyn/celestialbackground.html#galactic-coordinates

 
Precision
---------

At the moment we have one input list of coordinates in ``initial_coords.txt``,
generated by ``generate.py``, which is supposed to be interpreted as ``FK5 J2000`` coordinates.

Currently we compare results for all pairs of coordinate conversions between the following sky definitions:

===================  ========== ================ ======= ====================
Tag Name             Sky System Reference System Equinox Epoch of observation
===================  ========== ================ ======= ====================
fk5                  equatorial fk5              J2000   J2000
fk4                  equatorial fk4              B1950   ???
icrs                 equatorial icrs             ???     ???
galactic             galactic   ???              ???     ???
ecliptic             ecliptic   ???              J2000   ???
===================  ========== ================ ======= ====================
